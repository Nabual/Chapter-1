### What I Learned
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit by Google that enables cross-platform app development for mobile, web, and desktop using a single codebase. It offers several benefits, such as high performance, customizable widgets, and a "hot reload" feature for faster development. Setting up Flutter involves installing the Flutter SDK, configuring an IDE (like VS Code or Android Studio), and preparing a physical or virtual device for testing. I also learned about Flutter's widget-based architecture, where everything is represented as either stateless or stateful widgets.
### Achievement
I successfully installed the Flutter SDK, configured the IDE (VS Code/Android Studio), and verified the setup using the flutter doctor command, ensuring all tools were properly integrated.
